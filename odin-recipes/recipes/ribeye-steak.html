        <h3 class="sub-heading">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul id="ingredients">
            <li>1 <strong>Ribeye Steak</strong></li>
            <li>3-4 tsp <strong>Salt</strong></li>
            <li>Large cube of <strong>Butter</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Thyme</strong> or <strong>Rosemary</strong></li>
            <li>2 or 3 cloves of <strong>Garlic</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Steps</h3>
        <ol id="steps">
            <li>We take our Ribeye Steak (defrosted) and season it with our salt. Make sure to apply a generous (3-4 tsp) even coating of seasoning.</li>
            <li>Take a cast-iron pan and add a large healthy cube of butter, our cloves of garlic and our Thyme or Rosemary</li>
            <li>Fire up our stove by applying high to medium heat, let the butter melt for about 3-4 minutes</li>
            <li>Then we take our Ribeye Steak and gently place it on the cast-iron pan from top to bottom (dont be afraid of the sizzling sound!)</li>
            <li>Leave the steak there for 5-7 minutes before flipping it over</li>
            <li>Once flipped, we angle our skillet towards ourself on an approximate 30-degree angle, keep the steak at the top of the skillet (make sure not to spill any butter!) </li>
            <li>Take a spoon and scoop and pour the butter at the bottom of the pan to the steak, this method is called basting, depending on how we want our steak done
                 we baste the steak til our steak reaches 125 degrees of internal temperature</li>
            <li>Once temperature is up to your standards, take it out of the pan and serve on a plate!</li>
