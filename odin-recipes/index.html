            The meat has a rich flavor and juicy finish due to the large amount of marbling, or fat flowing through the meat.
             The muscle in this part of the cow isn't used much because it doesn't get much exercise, so the flesh is nice and tender. 
             A rib-eye steak typically fills the plate and is a good portion size, so it makes an excellent steak meal.
